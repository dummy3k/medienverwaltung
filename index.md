Medienverwaltung
================

This is a piece of software to organize and browse your media.
It tries to be clean and simple. Right now it focuses on quickly adding
large amounts of books and DVDs.

To do so it uses the Amazon Webservice to get the picture and list of
persons associated to the medium. List of persons may include directors
and actors of a movie or the author of a book.

Please have a look at the [screenshots](screenshots.html) to see what it
looks like.
