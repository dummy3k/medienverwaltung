Downloads
=========

Windows
-------
The installer contains a basic python environment and will download the
latest version automatically.
Because of this you have to be connected to the Internet while
installing it.
You may even install it as an non administrative user.
You won't even need a database installed, because Sqlite will be used.

If you did not understand any this, never mind. Just download and run it
it will work.
